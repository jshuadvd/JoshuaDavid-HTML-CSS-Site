					  	<p>Hello! My name is Joshua David and I am from Charlotte, NC. I am infatuated with technology, especially hardware <br> and software. I love to create! Being able to take nothing and turn it into something is fascinating to me.  I enjoy living a <br>healthy lifestyle and I like to cook. One of  the quotes that I try to live by is Epehsians 3:18 - 3:21: And I pray<br> that you, being rooted and established  in love, may have power, together with all the Lord’s holy people, to grasp how wide<br> and long and high and deep is the  love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to<br> the measure of all the fullness of God. All glory to God, who is able, through his mighty power at work within us, to<br> accomplish infinitely, exceedingly, and abundantly more than all we could ever ask or think or imagine.

					  		<p> In twelfth grade I was forced to drop out of High school to take care of my family due to the death of my father. From<br> that time I have taken the initiative to learn as much as I can on my own through internships, externships, and <br>trial and error. In addition, I have taken online courses from MIT, Udacity and Udemy. I am a self taught musician<br> and composer, sound engineer, graphic and web designer as well as an array of other endeavors in which I still <br>continue  to self study on a daily basis. I have worked in the aforementioned areas for the past 15 years. </p>

						<h3 class="">Experience With Programming</h3>
						<p class="">Some time ago, I needed a website for one of my businesses and had no idea where to begin. I found an online template, but I didn't want to use the template the way it was. I opened it up in Dreamweaver and began moving things around. Soon enough, I completed the project and my friends liked it so much that they asked me to do the same for them.  <br />
			<br />
			After doing this a few times I started getting the hang of HTML and CSS. After that I started playing around in Flash and Wordpress and eventually became able to hack around and manipulate the code to do what I wanted it to. And if I didn't know how to do something, I would search around online until I found an answer. I'm not at a point where I can write code completely from scratch, but I can interpret it, for the most part, and have a basic understanding of the fundamental concepts. I have also built some applications by following along with online tutorials, which you can view on my <a href="https://github.com/jshuadvd?tab=repositories">GitHub.</a></p>

						<h3 class="">Tools And Languages</h3>
						<p class="">To build this site I created a mock-up in Photoshop and then hand coded everything in Coda 2. I usually use Sublime Text 3, but I had Coda and have never really used it before, so I wanted to try it out. The site only consists of HTML and CSS as you will be able to see when you view the code. I used Firefox and Firebug to preview and debug and for version control I am using Github. I am also using iTerm for the command line to commit my repositories. I usually use my iPad and iPhone to check responsive features, but I haven't had time to do the media queries at the point of writing this. I hope that I am able to get to it before the submission deadline. Lastly, I used stack overflow because I ran into a problem with div positioning while creating the hexagon hovers.  <br />
			<br />
			I would have liked to make the site more dynamic, but you mentioned that it needed to be hand coded and would have had to pull from this great CSS3 library I like to use located <a href="http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/  ">here.</a></p>

					  <h2 style="color: #f1f1f1" align="center">Learn</h2>
					  	<p>I love learning! I have an immense passion for it. My views on learning can be summed up in one quote from the great Albert Einstein, "I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." It is proven that with curiosity we can reach great bounds and discover the unknown.  I believe learning is an invaluable asset and if we are to stop learning, then we cease growing. It is my belief that the most effective learning is collaborative, active and meaningful.
I set aside time everyday to acquire new knowledge.</p>

					  <h2 style="color: #686868" align="center">Serve</h2>
					  	<p>We have all been given the gift to help others. Christ is the ultimate servant and we are to model our lives after His. In essence we have to serve. It is the only way to build and grow others. Serving coincides with love and in love we do whatever it takes to express not only the act of love, but selfless nature and compassion. Whether it may be volunteering, helping out a friend, or just stopping to help a stranger who is on the side of the road, serving shouldn't be a choice, but a part of our daily lives. Just like eating breakfast.   </p>

								<h3 class="">To Be A Software Craftsman...</h3>
								<p class="">Precision, diligence, determination and rigor are terms that come to mind while thinking of a software craftsman. The thing is, I don't see that it ends there, or anywhere for that matter. Being a craftsman means "master of your craft," which is knowing your tools and being a perfectionist. With software you constantly have to improve and learn new technologies. That is the great part! You can keep growing and advancing indefinitely. <br />
					<br />
					Craftsmanship is not a destination; it's a life-long discipline. Not only must you continue to improve, but you have to take pride in your work and strive to be the best that you can. Being a software craftsman is a privilege and an honor. </p>

							<div class="right-article-divided">
								<h3 class="">Why Do I Want To Be A Software Craftsman?</h3>
								<p class="">Creating software is partially about breaking down everything to first principals, having a solid foundation, and in developing software, you are able to take a blank slate and create something that will be able to simplify the lives of millions of people. I also hold closely the qualities of what I think it means to be a software craftsman and I strive to attain that goal and personification.   <br />
									
					<br />As mentioned previously, I love software and technology in general, as cliche as it may sound, I can do what I love and help others while doing it!

					  	<p>I know that I will be able to complete this intense immersion session because I have been through extreme circumstances and come out on top. I always find a way where there is no way and though no man is an island, I have all the tools necessary to complete the task. I plan to simplify my life so that I can fully focus on my classroom. Furthermore, I will dedicate my time to nothing but this endeavor. I have a strong network of friends, family, and mentors to provide emotional support. In addition to my dedication and passion, I also consider myself to be resourceful and fully capable of using the resources in my community to keep me mentally, physically and emotionally prepared for the demands of this immersion commitment.
